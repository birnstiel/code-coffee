# Code Coffee

## Why?

*Code coffee* is something like a self-help group of people at the [University Observatory Munich](http://www.usm.lmu.de) that want to chat about things related to computing - *coders anonymous* if you will.

Irrespective of our field or our research focus, we all interact with computers on a daily basis on a large variety of issues:

- writing simulation/analysis codes
- writing `LaTeX` (papers, lectures, exams)
- creating visualizations
- submitting jobs on high performance computers
- compiling code
- reading, writing data files
- creating material for lectures
- creating websites
- preparing lectures or presentations
- ...

Instead of reinventing the weel every time, we thought it would be useful to share our experiences and learn from each other. The goal of *Code Coffee* is to find topics that can be of interest to most of us and to *very informally and interactively* present to each other. We do not aim for highly polished in-depth talks (those are ok too, of course!). But instead, it should be more of a common discussion where someone starts a topic showing what he/she found out and perhaps someone else can even add to it and everybody learns something.

This could be like:

> *"I stumbled over this new ... package which I found really useful. This is how it works ..."*

> *"I started using the ... editor and it has a couple of nice features that many people will like."*

> *"I had to create an interactive visualization for outreach, this is what I did: ..."*

> *"Many people have to do ... . Here's the best way to get this done."*

> *"This week Dr. `X`, author of the `Y` code/package is visiting us and will give us an introduction to ... ."*

## What?

We are very open to all topics that fit into the scope presented above. You can

- suggest a topic that you can present yourself (ideal case), or
- suggest topics that you *think* are interesting, but cannot present something. Hopefully someone else knows about it and might be able to present something.

We depend on having interesting talks and people to get discussions started - feel free to also invite external speakers, such as visitors that can contribute something.

Future topics including possible speakers can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/birnstiel/code-coffee/wiki).

## When?

We will meet bi-weekly **Mondays at 2pm in the seminar room.** Topics will be announced on the mailing list and can also be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/birnstiel/code-coffee/wiki).
